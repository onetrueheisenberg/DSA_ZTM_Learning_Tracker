If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: BFS
Answer: BFS

If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: DFS
Answer: BFS, because DFS takes a very long time to go through each node, its slower than BFS

If the tree is very wide: BFS
Answer: DFS, because BFS will need too much extra memory to go through all the nodes and track all nodes at current level

If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS
Answer: DFS

Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS
Answer: DFS

Finding the shortest path: BFS
Answer: BFS
